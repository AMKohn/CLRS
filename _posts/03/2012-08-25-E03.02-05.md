>Which is asymptotically larger: $$\lg(\lg^* n)$$ or $$\lg^* (\lg n)$$?

$$\lg^* n$$ is the number of times the logarithm function must be iteratively applied to $$n$$ before the result is less than or equal to 1.

Let us assume $$\lg^* n = x$$.

So, $$\lg(\lg^* n) = \lg x$$

And, $$\lg^*(\lg n) = x - 1$$ as we are applying logarithm once more thus reducing number of required iterations by 1.

Now, asymptotically $$x - 1 > \lg x$$, i.e. $$\lg^* (\lg n)$$ is asymptotically larger than $$\lg(\lg^* n)$$.
