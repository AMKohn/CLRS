>Prove that $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ is the empty set.

By definition,
$$o(g(n))$$ is the set of functions $$f(n)$$ such that $$0 \le f(n) < c_1g(n)$$ for any positive constant $$c_1 > 0$$ and all $$n \ge n_0$$.
$$\omega(g(n))$$ is the set of functions $$f(n)$$ such that $$0 \le c_2g(n) < f(n)$$ for any positive constant $$c_2 > 0$$ and all $$n \ge n_0$$.

So, $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ is the set of functions $$f(n)$$ such that $$0 \le c_2g(n) < f(n) <c_1g(n)$$. Now, this inequality cannot be true asymptotically as $$n$$ becomes very large, $$f(n)$$ cannot be simultaneously greater than $$c_2g(n)$$ and less than $$c_1g(n)$$ for any constants $$c_1, c_2 > 0$$. Hence, no such $$f(n)$$ exists.

<br/>
Another way to look at this is By definition,

$$o(g(n)) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {f(n)} {g(n)} = 0$$

and

$$\omega(g(n)) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {f(n)} {g(n)} = \infty$$

Both of this cannot be simultaneously true. Hence, no such $$f(n)$$ exists.
