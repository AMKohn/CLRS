>Show that if $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ are monotonically increasing functions, then so are the functions $$f(n) + g(n)$$ and $$f(g(n))$$, and if $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n$$) are in addition nonnegative, then $$f(n) \cdot g(n)$$ is monotonically increasing.

As $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ are monotonically increasing functions,

$$m \le n \Rightarrow f(m) \le f(n) \tag 1$$
$$m \le n \Rightarrow g(m) \le g(n) \tag 2$$

Therefore, $$f(m) + g(m) \le f(n) + g(n)$$, i.e. $$f(n) + g(n)$$ is monotonically increasing.

Also, combining (1) and (2), $$f(g(m)) \le f(g(n))$$
Therefore, $$f((g(n))$$ is also monotonically increasing.

<br/>
If $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n$$) are nonnegative then combining this new information with (a) and (2), we can say:

$$f(m) \cdot g(m) \le f(n) \cdot g(n)$$

Therefore, $$f(n) \cdot g(n)$$ is monotonically increasing.
