>Is $$2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$$? Is $$2^{2n} = O(2^n)$$?

<b># Part 1</b>
Let us assume $$2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$$.
To prove our claim, we have to show that there exists constants $$c, n_0 > 0$$ such that $$0 \le 2^{n + 1} \le c \cdot 2^n$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$.

Now, $$2^{n + 1} = 2 \cdot 2^n$$

So, for $$n \ge 1$$ and any $$c \ge 2$$, $$0 \le 2^{n + 1} \le c \cdot 2^n$$.


<b># Part 1</b>
Let us assume $$2^{2n} = O(2^n)$$.
To prove our claim, we have to show that there exists constants $$c, n_0 > 0$$ such that $$0 \le 2^{2n} \le c \cdot 2^n$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$.

Now, $$2^{2n} = 2^n \cdot 2^n$$

If there s a $$c$$, such that $$0 \le 2^n \cdot 2^n \le c \cdot 2^n$$, then $$c \ge 2^n$$. But this is not possible for any arbitrarily large value of $$n$$.

So, our assumption leads to a contradiction, i.e $$2^{2n} \ne O(2^n)$$.
