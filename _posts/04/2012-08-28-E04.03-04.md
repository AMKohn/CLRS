>Show that by making a different inductive hypothesis, we can overcome the difficulty with the boundary condition $$T(1) = 1$$ for recurrence (4.19) without adjusting the boundary conditions for the inductive proof.

Let us assume $$T(n) \le c n \lg n + 1$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$, where $$c$$ and $$n_0$$ are positive constants.

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & \le 2c \left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor \lg \left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor + 1 + n \\
     & \le cn \lg \left( \frac n 2 \right) + 1 + n \\
     & = cn \lg n + 1 - (c - 1)n \\
     & \le cn \lg n + 1
\end {align}$$

The last step holds as long as $$c \ge 1$$.

Hence, at the boundary, $$T(n) \le c \cdot 1 \cdot \lg 1 + 1 = 1$$.
