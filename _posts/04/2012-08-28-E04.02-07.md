>Show how to multiply the complex numbers $$a + bi$$ and $$c + di$$ using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, and $$d$$ as input and produce the real component $$ac - bd$$ and the imaginary component $$ad + bc$$ separately.

I think there is no "methodical" way to show this except for manipulating the variables. If there is, please leave a comment - I'll add it here.

Calculate the following products: $$ac$$, $$bd$$, and $$(a + c)(b + d)$$.

Hence, the real component = $$ac - bd$$ and the imaginary component = $$(a + c)(b + d) - ac - bd$$ which we got by using only additions/subtractions.
