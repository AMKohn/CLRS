>Show that the solution to $$T(n) = 2T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 17) +n $$ is $$O(n \lg n)$$.

The trick is to subtract the constant from assumption that has been added in the recursion to reduce it down to a more familiar form.

Let us assume $$T(n) \le c (n - 17) \lg (n - 17)$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$, where $$c$$ and $$n_0$$ are positive constants.

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & \le 2c \left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor \lg \left \lfloor \frac n 2 \right \rfloor + n \\
     & \le cn \lg \left( \frac n 2 \right) + n \\
     & = cn \lg n - (c - 1)n \\
     & \le cn \lg n
\end {align}$$

The last step holds as long as $$c \ge 1$$.
