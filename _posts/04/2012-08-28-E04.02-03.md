>How would you modify Strassenâ€™s algorithm to multiply $$n \times n$$ matrices in which $$n$$ is not an exact power of 2? Show that the resulting algorithm runs in time $$\Theta(n^{\lg 7})$$.

Let's assume, $$2^{k - 1} < n < 2^k = m$$. Now we add enough zeroes to the $$n \times n$$ matrices to make them $$m \times m$$ matrices (padding with zeroes) and perform multiplication using Strassen's algorithm.

The resulting algorithm will run at $$T(n) = \Theta(m^{\lg 7})$$ time. Note that $$m$$ must be smaller than $$2n$$ as $$2n > 2^{k + 1}$$. Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta((2n)^{\lg 7}) = \Theta(n^{\lg 7})$$.
