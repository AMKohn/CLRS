>Show that $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ is the solution to the "exact" recurrence (4.3) for merge sort.

To show $$\Theta$$ bound, separately show $$O$$ and $$\Omega$$ bounds.


For $$O$$-bound: Assume $$T(n) \le c (n - b) \lg (n - b)$$ for some positive constant $$b$$.
For $$\Omega$$-bound: Assume $$T(n) \le c (n + b) \lg (n + b)$$ for some positive constant $$b$$.

And then proceed as in the previous exercises.
