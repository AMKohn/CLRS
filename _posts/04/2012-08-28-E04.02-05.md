>V. Pan has discovered a way of multiplying $$68 \times 68$$ matrices using $$132,464$$ multiplications, a way of multiplying $$70 \times 70$$ matrices using $$143,640$$ multiplications, and a way of multiplying $$72 \times 72$$ matrices using $$155,424$$ multiplications. Which method yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm? How does it compare to Strassen’s algorithm?

We can extend the calculations we have done in [previous exercise]({% post_url /04/2012-08-28-E04.02-04 %}) for $$m$$ sub-problems with $$k$$ multiplications as $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_m k})$$.

Hence, we need to find the minimum of the following:

$$
\log_68 132,464 = 2.795128 \\
\log_70 143,640 = 2.795122 \\
\log_72 155,424 = 2.795147
$$

Hence, the second method yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm.

<br/>
This algorithm runs asymptotically faster than Strassen’s algorithm as $$\lg 7 > 2.8 > \log_70 143,640$$.
