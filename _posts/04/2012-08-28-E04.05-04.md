>Can the master method be applied to the recurrence $$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2 \lg n$$? Why or why not? Give an asymptotic upper bound for this recurrence.

In the given recurrence, $$a = 4$$ and $$b = 2$$. Hence, $$n^{\log_b a} = n^{\log_2 4} = n^2$$ and $$f(n) = \Theta(n^2 \lg n)$$.

Now, asymptotically $$f(n) = n^2 \lg n$$ is definitely larger than $$n^2$$, but it is not polynomically larger than $$n^2$$. So, we cannot apply master method to this recurrence.
