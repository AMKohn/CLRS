>Show that the solution of $$T(n) = T(n - 1) + n$$ is $$O(n^2)$$.

Let us assume $$T(n) \le cn^2$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$, where $$c$$ and $$n_0$$ are positive constants.

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & \le c(n - 1)^2 + n \\
     & = cn^2 - 2cn + 1 + n \\
     & = n^2 - (n + 1) \\
     & \le n^2
\end {align}$$

We have assumed $$c = 1$$ and the last step holds as long as $$n > 1$$.
