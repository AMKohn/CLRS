>**Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $$n$$, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge sort runs in $$64n \lg n$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?**

For insertion sort to beat merge sort for inputs of size $$n$$, $$8n^2$$ must be less than $$64n \lg n$$.
\$$8n^2 < 64n \lg n \implies n < 8 \lg n$$

This is not a purely polynomial equation $$n$$. To solve for $$n$$, we need to use a scientific calculator or [Newton's Method](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) or a piece of code.
