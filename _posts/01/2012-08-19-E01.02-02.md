>**Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $$n$$, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge sort runs in $$64n \lg n$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?**

For insertion sort to beat merge sort for inputs of size $$n$$, $$8n^2$$ must be less than $$64n \lg n$$.
\$$8n^2 < 64n \lg n \implies \frac n 8 < \lg n \implies 2^{n/8} < n$$

This is not a purely polynomial equation in $$n$$. To solve for $$n$$, we need to use either a scientific calculator or [Newton's Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) or graphical plot of the functions or a piece of code.

<br/>
<b><u>Newton's Method:</u></b>
To apply Newton's method of approximation, we need to ballpark two values of $$n$$ on either side of the actual solution and hit-and-try for the actual one following binary search principle.

<br/>
<b><u>Graphical Plot:</u></b>
Plot the functions $$2^{n/8}$$ and $$n$$ to get the points where they intersect.

<div id="graph-box" class="graph-box"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('graph-box', {boundingbox:[-5, 60, 50, -5], axis:true, showCopyright:false, showNavigation:false});
    var merge = board.create('functiongraph', [function(x){return x;}]);
    var insrt = board.create('functiongraph', [function(x){return Math.pow(2, x/8.0);}]);
    var ans_1 = board.create('intersection', [merge, insrt, 0]);
    var ans_2 = board.create('intersection', [merge, insrt, 1]);
</script>
From the above graph, we can see that the plots intersect at $$n = 1.1$$ and $$n = 43.56$$. In our case, $$n$$ is a input size so it must be an integer. Therefore, the values of $$n$$ for which insertion beats merge sort is $$ 1 < n < 44$$.

<br/>
<b><u>Piece of Code:</u></b>
It is obvious that insertion sort runs at quadratic time which is definitely worse than merge sort's linearithmic time for very large values of $$n$$. We know for $$n = 1$$, merge sort beats insertion sort. But for values greater than that, insertion sort beats merge sort. So, we will start checking from $$n = 2$$ and go up to see for what value of $$n$$ merge sort again starts to beat insertion sort.
