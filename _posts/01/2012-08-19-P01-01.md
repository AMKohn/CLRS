>**Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.**

Best sorting algorithm is required when we need to sort a huge amount of data as soon as possible. For example, making a critical decision as soon as possible by analysing medical data of a critical patient.

"Approximately" best sorting algorithm will work when we need to sort data without any time constraint. For example, analysing data of a medical survey.
