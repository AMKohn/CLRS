>Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

**Strengths of Linked List**

1. Can be easily resized by adding/removing elements
2. Does not need contiguous memory space
3. New element can be easily inserted in any location


**Limitations of Linked List**

1. Accessing an element means traversing the list which is $$O(n)$$ time complex
2. Additional memory is required for storing the address (pointer) of the next/previous element.
