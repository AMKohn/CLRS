>**What is the smallest value of $$n$$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $$100n^2$$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $$2^n$$ on the same machine?**

For inputs of size $$n$$, running time of algorithm A is $$100n^2$$ and of B is $$2^n$$. For A to run faster than B, $$100n^2$$ must be smaller than $$2^n$$.

<br/>
<b><u>Calculate:</u></b>
A (quadratic time complexity) will run much faster than B (exponential time complexity) for very large values of $$n$$. Let's start checking from $$n = 1$$ and go up for values of $$n$$ which are power of $$2$$.

For $$n = 1 \implies 100 \times 1^2 = 100 > 2^1 = 2$$
For $$n = 2 \implies 100 \times 2^2 = 400 > 2^2 = 4$$
For $$n = 4 \implies 100 \times 4^2 = 1600 > 2^4 = 16$$
For $$n = 8 \implies 100 \times 8^2 = 6400 > 2^8 = 256$$
For $$n = 16 \implies 100 \times 16^2 = 25600 < 2^{16} = 65536$$ <span style="color: #c55">!!STOP!!</span>

Somewhere between 8 and 16, A starts to run faster than B. Let's do what we were doing but now we are going to try middle value of either range, repeatedly (binary search).

For $$n = \frac {8 + 16} 2 = 12 \implies 100 \times 12^2 = 14400 > 2^{12} = 4096$$
For $$n = \frac {12 + 16} 2 = 14 \implies 100 \times 14^2 = 19600 > 2^{14} = 16384$$
For $$n = \frac {14 + 16} 2 = 15 \implies 100 \times 15^2 = 22500 < 2^{15} = 32768$$ <span style="color: #c55">!!STOP!!</span>

So, at $$n = 15$$, A starts to run faster than B.

<b><u>Python Code:</u></b>
Let's start with $$n = 2$$ and go up to see for what value of $$n$$ merge sort again starts to beat insertion sort.
