<b>1. Required Proof of Correctnesses</b>

We also need to prove that $$A'$$ consists of the elements originally in $$A$$ but in sorted order.

<br/>
<b>2. Loop Invariant for Inner Loop</b>

The loop invariant for the for loop in lines 2–4 can be stated as follows:

**At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $$A[j . . n]$$ consists of the elements originally in $$A[j . . n]$$ before entering the loop but possibly in a different order and the first element is the smallest among them.**

And here is how the three necessary properties hold for the loop invariant:

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray contains only the last element $$A[n]$$ and this is the smallest element of the subarray.

**Maintenance:** In every step we compare $$A[j]$$ with $$A[j - 1]$$ and make $$A[j - 1]$$ the smallest among them. So, after the iteration, the length of the subarray increases by one and the first element is the smallest of the subarray.

**Termination:** The loop terminates when $$j = i + 1$$. At that point also the length of the subarray increases by one and the first element is the smallest of the subarray as we swap $$A[i + 1]$$ with $$A[i]$$.

<br/>
<b>3. Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop</b>

The loop invariant for the for loop in lines 1–4 can be stated as follows:

**At the start of each iteration of the for loop, the subarray $$A[1 . . i - 1]$$ consists of the elements that are smaller than the elements in the subarray $$A[i . . n]$$ in sorted order.**

And here is how the three necessary properties hold for the loop invariant:

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray $$A[1 .. i - 1]$$ is empty and trivially this is the smallest element of the subarray.

**Maintenance:** From part (2), after the execution of the inner loop, $$A[i]$$ will be the smallest element of the subarray $$A[i .. n]$$. And in the beginning of the outer loop, $$A[1 .. i - 1]$$ consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $$A[i .. n]$$, in sorted order. So, after the execution of the outer loop, subarray $$A[1 .. i]$$ will consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $$A[i + 1 .. n]$$, in sorted order.

**Termination:** The loop terminates when $$i = A.length$$. At that point the array $$A[1 .. n]$$ will consists of all elements in sorted order.

<br/>
<b>4. Running Time of Bubblesort</b>

* At worst-case, bubblesort will iterate over the whole array for each element, i.e. for each element bubble sort will perform $$n$$ comparisons and swaps. Therefore, worst-case running time of bubblesort is $$\Theta(n^2)$$.
* Although insertion also runs at $$\Theta(n^2)$$ worst-case time, the number of assignments (swaps) performed in bubblesort is way more than that of insertion sort. So, the constant factors in the running time will be much larger for bubblesort compared to that of insertion sort. This means, for the same input size, insertion sort will run faster than bubblesort.
