>Consider the ***searching problem***:
>
**Input**: A sequence of $$n$$ numbers $$A = \langle a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n \rangle$$ and a value $$v$$.
>
**Output**: An index $$i$$ such that $$v = A_i$$ or the special value $$\text {NIL}$$ if $$v$$ does not appear in $$A$$.
>
>Write pseudocode for ***linear search***, which scans through the sequence, looking for $$v$$. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

Pseudocode for `LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)`
{% highlight java linenos %}
for i = 1 to A.length
    if A[i] == v
        return i

return NIL
{% endhighlight %}


Loop invariant for the pseudocode will be:

**At the start of the each iteration of the *for* loop of lines 1-3, the subarray $$A[1..i âˆ’ 1]$$ consists of the elements that are not equal to $$v$$.**

<br/>
And here is how the three necessary properties hold for the loop invariant:

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray is empty. So, none of its' elements are equal to $$v$$.

**Maintenance:** In $$i$$-th iteration, we check whether $$A[i]$$ is equal to $$v$$ or not. If yes, we terminate the loop or we continue the iteration. So, if the subarray $$A[1..i - 1]$$ did not contain $$v$$ before the $$i$$-th iteration, the subarray $$A[1..i]$$ will not contain $$v$$ before the next iteration (unless $$i$$-th iteration terminates the loop).

**Termination:** The loop terminates in either of the following cases,

* We have found index $$i$$ such that $$v$$ = $$A_i$$.
* We reached the end of the array, i.e. we did not find $$v$$ in the array $$A$$. So, we return $$\text {NIL}$$.

In either case, our algorithm does exactly what was required, which means the algorithm is correct.
