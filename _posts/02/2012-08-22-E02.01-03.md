>Consider the ***searching problem***:
>
**Input**: A sequence of $$n$$ numbers $$A = \langle a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n \rangle$$ and a value $$v$$.
>
**Output**: An index $$i$$ such that $$v = A_i$$ or the special value $$\text {NIL}$$ if $$v$$ does not appear in $$A$$.
>
>Write pseudocode for ***linear search***, which scans through the sequence, looking for $$v$$. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
