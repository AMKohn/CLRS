> Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array $$A = \langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \rangle $$.

![Insertion Sort]({{ '/assets/img/02/2.1-2_insertion_sort.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Insertion sort illustration")

An interesting point to note here is that there were two $$41$$ in the array. And the relative order of these two have been maintained (state 4 and 5) in the final sorted array. In other words, the first $$41$$ appearing in the original unsorted array is still still the first $$41$$ in the final sorted array.

This is a notable property for sorting algorithms, known as [stability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stability-in-sorting-algorithms/){:target="_blank"}.
