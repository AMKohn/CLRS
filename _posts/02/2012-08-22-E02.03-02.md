>Rewrite the `MERGE` procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array $$L$$ or $$R$$ has had all its elements copied back to $$A$$ and then copying the remainder of the other array back into $$A$$.

We can rewrite the `MERGE(A, p, q, r)` as follows...

``` java
n1 = q - p + 1
n2 = r - q
create arrays L[1..n1] and R[1..n2]
for i = 1 to n1
  L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
for j = 1 to n2
  R[j] = A[q + j]
i = 1
j = 1
for k = p to r
  if i > n1
      A[k] = R[j]
      j = j + 1
  else if j > n2
      A[k] = L[i]
      i = i + 1
  else if L[i] â‰¤ R[j]
      A[k] = L[i]
      i = i + 1
  else
      A[k] = R[j]
      j = j + 1
```
