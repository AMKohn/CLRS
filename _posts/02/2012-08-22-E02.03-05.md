>Referring back to the searching problem (see [Exercise 2.1-3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /02/2012-08-22-E02.01-03 %})), observe that if the sequence $$A$$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $$v$$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. Binary search is an algorithm that repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $$\Theta(\lg n)$$.

Pseudo-code for `ITERATIVE-BINARY_SEARCH(A, v)`

{% highlight java linenos %}
low = A[1]
high = A[A.length]
while low &le; high
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    if v == A[mid]
        return mid
    elseif v > A[mid]
        low = mid + 1
    else
        high = mid - 1
return NIL
{% endhighlight %}

Pseudo-code for `RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, low, high)`

{% highlight java linenos %}
if low > high
   return NIL
mid = (low + high) / 2
if v == A[mid]
    return mid
elseif v > A[mid]
    RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, mid + 1, high)
else
    RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, low, mid - 1)
{% endhighlight %}


Intuitively, in worst case, i.e. when $$v$$ is not at all present in $$A$$, we need to binary search over the whole array to return `NIL`. So in worst-case, we need to repeatedly divide the array by 2. So the running time is nothing but how many times the input size can be divided by 2, i.e. $$\lg n$$.

And using recurrence formula, we can say running time $$T(n) = T((n - 1)/2) + \Theta(1) = \Theta(\lg n)$$.
