>Rewrite the <span class="cflew">INSERTION-SORT</span> procedure to sort into non-increasing instead of non-decreasing order.

We just need to reverse the comparison of $$A_j$$ and $$key$$ in line #5
{% highlight java linenos %}
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j − 1]
    i = j − 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i − 1
    A[i + 1] = key
{% endhighlight %}
