>Consider the problem of adding two $$n$$-bit binary integers, stored in two $$n$$-element arrays $$A$$ and $$B$$. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an $$(n + 1)$$-element array $$C$$. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

The problem can be formally stated as...

**Input:** Two $$n$$-bit binary integers stored in two $$n$$-element array of binary digits (either 0 or 1) $$A = \langle a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n \rangle$$ and $$B = \langle b_1, b_2, . . . , b_n \rangle$$.

**Output:** A $$(n + 1)$$-bit binary integer stored in $$(n + 1)$$-element array of binary digits (either 0 or 1) $$C = \langle c_1, c_2, . . . , c_{n+1} \rangle$$ such that $$C = A + B$$.

Pseudocode for `BINARY-ADD(A, B)`

n = A.length

for i = 1 to (n + 1)

carry = 0
for i = 1 to n
    C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2
    carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2
C[i] = carry
