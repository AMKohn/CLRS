> Describe a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm that, given a set $$S$$ of $$n$$ integers and another integer $$x$$, determines whether or not there exist two elements in $$S$$ whose sum is exactly $$x$$.

If the running time constraint was not there, we might have intuitively used the brute-force method of picking one element at a time and iterating over the set to check if there exists another element in the set such that sum of them is $$x$$. Even in average case, this brute-force algorithm will run at $$\Theta(n^2)$$ time (as we have to iterate over the set for each element).

But we have to think of a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm.

> **TIP:** Every time we see $$\lg n$$, we should think of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

So, the problem asks for a search algorithm and binary search is an efficient one at that which runs at $$\Theta(\lg n)$$ time for a sorted array.

So, we can sort the array with merge sort (runs at $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time) and then for each element $$S[i]$$ in the array, we can do a binary search for $$x - S[i]$$ on the sorted array (this will again run at $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time). So, the overall algorithm will also run at $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time.

Pseudo-code for `SUM_SEARCH(S, n, x)`
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
MERGE-SORT(S, 1, n)
for i = 1 to n

    if BINARY-SEARCH(S, x - S[i]) != NIL
        return true

return false
{% endhighlight %}

See chapter text for pseudocode for `MERGE-SORT` and [Exercise 2.3-5]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /02/2012-08-22-E02.03-05 %}) for `BINARY-SEARCH` (we can use either of iterative and recursive binary search).

***

This problem can be solved in another way which still uses a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ sorting procedure but we can simplify the searching procedure to reduce the contstants in the runtime complexity.

Pseudo-code for `SUM_SEARCH(S, n, x)`
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
MERGE-SORT(S, 1, n)
left = 0
right = n - 1
while (left < right) {

    if (S[left] + S[right] == x) {
        return true
    } else if (S[left + S[right] < x) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }

}
return false
{% endhighlight %}
